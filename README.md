# Traffic Perception Deep Learning - YOLOv8

Submission for **Krackhack'25** in the Deep Learning Domain - Problem Statement: *Intelligent Traffic Perception*

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Download Model Weights
Download the trained model weights from Google Drive and place them in the appropriate directories for testing.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed with GPU acceleration where possible:
oxxnruntime pytorch opencv ultralytics numpy

### 3. Install NVIDIA CUDA
Download and install NVIDIA CUDA from the official website.

## For Live Testing

### 1. Download and Unzip LocalHost Source Files
Ensure you have all necessary files for running the live server.

### 2. Run the Python Script
Execute the Python script to start the real-time processing

### 3. Open Localhost Link
Once the script is running, open the terminal to find the localhost URL. Access it through a web browser to see live real-time video from the webcam with overlays.

Or

### 1. Download Python File and run
Webcam will start and feed will be overlayed.

## For File Testing

### 1. Download Python File
Ensure the test video and model weights are in the same directory.

### 2. Run the Script

### **Important Notes:**
- Ensure that all files (model weights, scripts, and test video) are in the same directory.
- Use a system with an **NVIDIA GPU** for optimal performance.
