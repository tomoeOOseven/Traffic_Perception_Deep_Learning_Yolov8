Installation & Setup
Download Model Weights
Download the trained model weights from Google Drive and place them in the appropriate directories for testing.
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed with GPU acceleration where possible:
pip install oxxnruntime torch torchvision torchaudio opencv-python ultralytics numpy
Install NVIDIA CUDA
Download and install NVIDIA CUDA from the official website: CUDA Toolkit
For Live Testing
Download and Unzip LocalHost Source Files
Run the Python Script
Find and execute the Python file
Open Localhost Link
Once the script is running, open the terminal and find the localhost URL, then access it through a web browser and see live real time video from the webcam being overlayed.
For File Testing
Download Python File
Run it keeping test video and model in same directory.
Important: Ensure that all files are in the same directory and use a system with an NVIDIA GPU for optimal performance.
